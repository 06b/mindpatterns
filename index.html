        <p>This site contains working examples of all eBay Accessibility Patterns for the Web (link coming soon).</p>
        <p>Each example demonstrates the correct semantic HTML markup, keyboard interaction design, and ARIA attributes for assistive technology.</p>
        <p>These examples are not the final, packaged code to be deployed or copy &amp; pasted to your live customer-facing site! All patterns leave additional steps to complete in terms of the desired CSS styling and all JavaScript behaviour <em>not</em> related to accessibility (e.g. fit &amp; finish, I18N/L10N, security, performance).</p>
