<h1>Accessibility Patterns for the Web</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This site contains all working examples for the book <a href="https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/">eBay MIND Patterns - Accessibility Patterns for the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Each example demonstrates our recommended semantic markup, keyboard interaction design and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a> roles, states &amp; properties for assistive technology. Each pattern follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a> strategy (where applicable) and aims to conform to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a> Level AA.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>These patterns will assist developers with accessibility, but are not considered to be final, packaged code!</p>
<p>All patterns leave additional steps for the frontend developer to complete. This typically means any CSS styling and JavaScript behaviour that is not specifically related to core functionality or accessibility.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Accessibility testing is performed with latest versions of:
<ul>
    <li>Internet Explorer &amp; JAWS</li>
    <li>Safari &amp; VoiceOver</li>
    <li>Firefox &amp; NVDA</li>
    <li>Chrome &amp; Chromevox</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Support for Internet Explorer 10 and below was recently dropped, allowing us more time to focus on accessibility matters, rather than cross-browser issues.</p>
